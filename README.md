**Background**


_______________________________

Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

**Observations**


_______________________________

  * Mice treated with Capomulin, Ceftamin, Infubinol and Ramicane are the four drug regimens to observe, as indicated by having the lowest standard error of mean.

  * Of the four drug regimens examined, Capomulin and Ramicane were the best performing among the mice having nearly half the final tumor volume at the end of the trial.

  * The Capomulin treated mice showed that average tumor volume and the weight of the mouse were directly related, as indicated by the strong Pearson correlation.
